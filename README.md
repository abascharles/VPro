## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Video won't load

- Check if file format is supported
- Ensure file isn't corrupted or in use by another program
- Try copying file to local drive if on network storage

### Audio not playing

- Check volume is not muted (🔇 icon)
- Some video files may not contain audio tracks
- Player will continue with video-only if audio codec unsupported

### Large file is slow

- This is normal for files >500MB
- Allow time for initial loading
- Use frame stepping instead of rapid seeking

### GIF export takes long time

- Large time ranges take longer to process
- Reduce output size or duration for faster export
- Higher quality settings increase processing time

1. **Precise Editing:** Use frame stepping to find exact moments
2. **Quick Previews:** Export short GIF segments to preview edits
3. **Large Files:** Let large videos fully load before intensive navigation
4. **Quality vs Size:** Balance GIF quality settings for your needs
